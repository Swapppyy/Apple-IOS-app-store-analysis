## Apple IOS app store analysis

### Introduction:

I conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis on the Apple iOS App Store. This project involved examining and analyzing the dataset using SQL to extract valuable insights and trends related to app ratings, categories, monetization, and user engagement. The EDA aimed to uncover patterns and correlations within the data, providing a foundation for data-driven decision-making in the context of iOS app development and distribution.

I have also uploaded the datasets files in the repository, please feel free to use them.

#### My Insights:

- Paid apps have higher rating

- Apps which have between 10 and 30 languages have better ratings

- Finance and book apps have low ratings

- Apps with longer description have better ratings

- Games and entertainment have a high competition
